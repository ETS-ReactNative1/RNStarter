# React Native Starter

## Overview

Anyone who had to setup a React Native project from scratch would agree that it takes a lot of time and really can be quite some stress. This project contains a very easy to use React Native boilerplate for your next app. This project was made from the ground to be robust and very flexible support so it is easy to add new libraries as well remove unused libraries from the initial setup. The initial setup contains: 

- React Native
- Typescript
- NativeBase
- Styled Components
- React Navigation
- Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Apisauce
- Testing Library
- Detox
- ESLint and Prettier with pre-commit hooks
